## Design Processes
1. As a user, I want to be able to login with my email and get an OTP to verify, so that the account security is safe.
   We have a feature where users just have to key in their email to get an OTP to login. It is convenient and hassle-free, yet secure.
2. As a user, I want to be able to see my total cost in the shopping cart, so that I know how much I have to pay.
   Our shopping cart page is coded so that everything can be viewed in a singular page. It includes the quantity, the ability to delete items from cart and the price updates accordingly to     the quantity.
3. As a user, I want to be able to redeem vouchers, so that I can save money on shopping.
   We have a promo code section in the cart page where users can redeem their promo code if they have. In this case, DISCOUNT10 is the promo code for demonstration purposes.
4. As a user, I want to be able to contact staff if I encounter problems, so that I can resolve my issue(s) as soon as possible.
   We have a convenient contact us page, where users can either call us on the phone or just drop us a message in WhatsApp. Upon clicking on the WhatsApp icon, it will redirect users to      our WhatsApp chat immediately, providing convenience.
5. As a user, I want to be able to customise my own shoe, because I may not like some of the pre-designed shoes.
   We allow our users to customise their own shoes because we believe that everyone has different taste and preferences in design, be it colour or the shape of it.
6. As a user, I want to be able to have multiple payment methods.
   We allow our users to pay by cards or PayNow, as they are the most fastest and convenient way to pay currently.
